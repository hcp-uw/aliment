## About Aliment
Aliment is a recipe generator website. It allows users to search for recipes that use ingredients they have on hand and select filters according to their preferences. By simplifying the home cook's process, we also hope to encourage a decrease in food waste. Our team formed in the fall of 2023 and is constantly working on adding new features to the project.
